# hooo buddy where to start

## automation

creating _easily_ callable routines for actions such as a mining run for ship
or sending a probe to explore the universe

the glaringly obvious question here is... how do I call these routines?

- via CLI, somehow

ultimately, it would be super cool to be able to enter `spaceboats run` into bash and
have all or some operations (mining, exploration) run as a background process while

### first steps

- [] automate a mining run
  - sort of check - kinda shitty way to do it but idk what else to do about it

## caching

would like to use Prisma/Postgres cache data about ships, systems, agents, etc.
